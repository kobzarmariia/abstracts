# Networks Fundamentals

Understands the OSI model, the TCP/IP protocol suite, when to use TCP/UDP, as well as the most widely used application layer protocols (at least HTTP).

Network architecture:
  • Set of network layers and protocols
  • Interfaces are not included in the architecture

Protocol Stack:
  • Hierarchically organized set of protocols,
  sufficient for networking

Networking Concepts
  • Service - what makes a level
  • Protocol - how the layer does it
  • Interface - how to access a level service

Encapsulation:
  • Inclusion of a higher level message in
  downstream message
  • Message: header + data + trailer

**Networking Reference Models**

**Open Systems Interconnection Model (ISO OSI)**
  • Legal standard of an international organization
  ISO standardization
  • 7 levels, protocols are not included in the model
  • Good theoretical study
  • Not used in practice

**TCP/IP Model**
  • Actual standard based on popular stack
  TCP / IP protocols
  • 4 levels
  • TCP / IP protocols are widely used in practice
  • The basis of the Internet
